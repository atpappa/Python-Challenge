# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* In this challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. A set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) was provided. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* The created Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script prints both the analysis to the terminal and a text file is exported with the results.
## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* A set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv) was provided. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. This Python script analyzes  the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* The final script prints both the analysis to the terminal and a text file is exported with the results.
